            The first thing we do when you work with us is randomly generate 4000 different coordinates around the world and then find the nearest city to that coordinate. After removing duplicates, you get between 500-800 randomly selected possible vacation locations! We then pull that city's current weather forecasts including: temperature, windspeed, humidity, and cloud-cover forcasts. For many people temperature is make-or-break in their vacation spot decision, and it's also closely tied to where the location is in relation to the equator. While putting together our initial city data, we also pull in some statistics on the cities choosen. This Temperatures graph shows you every vacation city's temperature versus their latitude (0 being the equator) so that you can see exactly how thorough we are in our search for your perfect vacation spot.
