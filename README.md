# Web-Design-Challenge

This project is a webpage I designed as a sales-pitch to sell you a service using a "patented" (this is fake) algorithem to help plan your vacation based on your perfect weather preferences. This is referring to another Python API project I did. Please see my python-api-challenge repository for the code that I am "selling" in this webpage https://github.com/JKx2020/python-api-challenge

This project uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
